# Karma: Infrastructure as Consequence

Karma is an experimental model for building systems where every action or object is shaped by what came before it.

Unlike traditional deployment frameworks that focus purely on state or configuration, Karma treats infrastructure as a chain of consequences or a graph of dependencies that builds itself forward.

This page captures some of the early theory and guiding ideas behind the project.

## 1. Actions Have Lineage

Every infrastructure component, deployment, or data transformation exists because of a configuration that allowed it. That configuration came from somewhere — a file, a repo, a script, a decision.

In Karma, every object is traceable back to its origin.

- The current state is a function of declared inputs
- The original state traces back to source control
- Runtime modifications are possible
- Infrastructure becomes less imperative, more causal

---

## 2. Infrastructure is a Graph, Not a Tree

Most systems are modeled like trees:

- A root module or resource calls its children
- Dependency flow is top-down

But in reality, infrastructure is better described as a directed graph:

- Objects have many incoming and outgoing edges
- Dependencies are dynamic, sometimes cyclic, and often driven by shared state

Karma aims to expose this structure:

- Components are nodes
- Dependencies are edges
- Every deployment extends or modifies the graph

## 3. You Should Be Able to See It

Visualizing the system matters.

Karma aims to support future drag-and-drop interfaces and auto-generated diagrams that:

- Reflect the actual dependency graph
- Let you trace a deployment from origin to effect
- Make implicit relationships explicit

This isn’t just a UX feature — it’s central to understanding complex systems.

## 4. Composable Objects > Monolithic Environments

Karma encourages defining reusable, interoperable infrastructure components that:

- Are configured independently
- Can be instantiated multiple times
- Know how to participate in a larger system

Rather than defining everything in one central file or repo, Karma expects each component to carry enough metadata to know:

- Its type and purpose
- Its inputs and required dependencies
- Where its outputs should be published

---

## 5. The Future is Config-Driven

Karma is built on the idea that infrastructure should not require imperative logic to function. Configuration should be declarative, self-validating, and dynamic based on context.

- What exists in the system should reflect what's defined in config
- Parameter updates should be first-class operations
- State transitions should be observable and reversible

This enables a future where even complex changes can be reasoned about, visualized, and managed as part of a cohesive model.

## What's Next

The theory behind Karma is still evolving. This site — and the project — will grow as implementation catches up to intention.
