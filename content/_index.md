# Karma

**Infrastructure as Consequence.**

Karma is an experimental system for modeling infrastructure as modular, object-oriented components — where each deployment step is shaped by what came before.

Rather than building environments top-down, Karma encourages config-driven systems that evolve like a graph — each node connected to its lineage, and each step traceable to its origin.

---

## Why Karma?

- Modular, reusable infrastructure components  
- Declarative, visual dependency graphs  
- Object-oriented modeling across environments  
- Eventually: drag-and-drop design for system composition

## Beyond Infrastructure

Karma’s graph-based design has deep implications for machine learning, observability, and system introspection.

## Powered by Adage

Karma is built on top of [Adage](https://github.com/tstrall/adage), a deployment framework for configuration-first, testable infrastructure.
