# Data Science Implications

Karma treats infrastructure not as a static plan, but as a dynamic, evolving graph of decisions.  
This unlocks rich analysis, pattern discovery, and machine learning — not just for infrastructure optimization, but for understanding how systems evolve over time.

With every deployment, Karma turns infrastructure into structured, queryable data.

## Infrastructure as a Dataset

Each Karma-managed component:

- Has a stable identity (`nickname`, project, environment)
- Ingests versioned config from Git
- Emits runtime outputs validated by Terraform
- Exists as a node in a live graph stored in Amazon Neptune
- Tracks lineage: what changed, when, by whom — and why

This turns deployments into structured observations.

You can now ask:

- Which changes cause the most downstream breakage?
- What config patterns correlate with stable systems?
- How often does runtime drift from config — and for how long?
- What components tend to fail validation on first deploy?
- How many deployments precede a successful switchover?

## Graph Learning and Runtime Signals

Karma’s Neptune-backed graph enables:

- Learning embeddings for components and relationships
- Detecting anomalies in structure or dependency shifts
- Simulating proposed graph mutations before they’re applied
- Building classifiers that predict:
  - Deployment success
  - Risk of drift
  - Runtime health
  - Optimal reconfiguration paths

The infrastructure graph becomes a **living, learnable system** — capable of introspection and guided improvement.

## Event Streams and Feedback Loops

Karma logs every relevant event:

- Config changes
- Graph updates
- Terraform actions
- Runtime output deltas
- Validation failures
- Change request metadata

This enables reinforcement-like feedback:  
You can train models on historical outcomes and improve change routing, deployment policy, or approval logic.

Example: prefer promotion strategies that maximize long-term runtime convergence.

## Use Cases

- Visualizing drift over time as graph deltas  
- Forecasting rollback risk based on graph topology  
- Recommending safe dependency rewrites  
- Modeling config churn vs. incident volume  
- Detecting anti-patterns in graph shape or component coupling  
- Auto-suggesting required fields or missing config based on similarity

---

## Summary

Karma transforms infrastructure into a **causal graph** — not just a snapshot of what exists, but a story of how it got there.

Once infrastructure becomes structured and observable, it becomes **learnable**.

If you can track it, you can analyze it.  
If you can analyze it, you can design smarter systems.
