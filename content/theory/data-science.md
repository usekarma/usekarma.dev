# Data Science Implications

Karma treats infrastructure not as a static plan, but as a dynamic, evolving graph of decisions.  
This opens the door to rich analysis, pattern discovery, and machine learning — not just for infrastructure optimization, but for understanding how systems evolve.

## Infrastructure as a Dataset

Each component deployed through Karma:

- Has an identity (`nickname`, environment, project)
- Receives input config from versioned sources (Git)
- Outputs real-world runtime data (state, outputs, side effects)
- Lives within a graph of dependencies and references
- Is tied to a timeline: who deployed, when, why

This means every deployment becomes a structured, queryable data point.

You can now ask:

- Which changes caused the most downstream invalidations?
- What config patterns are correlated with long-lived systems?
- Which components tend to fail validation on first deploy?
- What’s the average drift between config and runtime across environments?

---

## Graph Learning and Runtime Signals

Because Karma models the system as a graph:

- You can learn embeddings for nodes and edges
- You can detect anomalous connections or structural changes
- You can simulate what-if impacts before rollout
- You can build classifiers that predict deployment success, validate runtime health, or suggest configuration improvements

The infrastructure graph becomes a living system — observable, learnable, and improvable.

## Event Streams and Feedback Loops

Karma's design enables:

- Event-based tracking of deployments, invalidations, and runtime updates  
- Centralized logging of switchover history  
- Promotion decisions based on test outcomes or external metrics  

This makes the system reinforcement-learnable:  
You can analyze whether certain promotion strategies lead to better long-term system health — and adjust automation accordingly.

---

## Use Cases

- Visualizing drift over time as a graph delta  
- Forecasting which components are most likely to require rollback  
- Recommending safe dependency graph rewrites  
- Modeling the relationship between config churn and incident volume  
- Auto-suggesting missing or unused config fields based on cluster behavior

---

## Summary

Karma treats infrastructure as a causal graph — not just what is, but what led to it.  
This opens new paths for machine learning, observability, and truly intelligent infrastructure.

If you can track it, you can learn from it.  
If you can learn from it, you can design smarter systems.
