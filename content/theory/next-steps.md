# Next Steps

This page outlines upcoming topics and expansions for the Karma documentation site. These pages will evolve into full entries but are currently gathered here as a shared roadmap and reference.

---

## Graph Schema

Document Karma's graph model in Neptune.

- **Node Types:** Component (with `type`, `environment`, `config_path`, `runtime_path`)
- **Edge Types:** `depends_on`, `emits_runtime_to`, `consumes_runtime_from`
- *Note: Components do not store their own nickname — it's tracked externally.*
- TODO: Add edge metadata and example diagrams.

---

## Querying the Graph

Gremlin or Karma CLI queries against Neptune.

```bash
karma graph query --gremlin 'g.V().count()'
```

- Common queries:
  - Downstream components
  - Orphans
  - Drift detection
  - Runtime consumers
- TODO: SPARQL support notes

---

## Change Coordination

How Karma safely applies config updates:

1. Accept proposed change
2. Validate input config
3. Analyze graph impact
4. Plan or apply
5. Update Parameter Store
6. Write graph delta to Neptune
7. Log result

Planned features:
- Queued change sets
- Dry-run mode
- Approval hooks

---

## Developer Onboarding

Fast path to contributing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usekarma/karma.git
cd karma
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```

- Requires Python 3.10+ and AWS credentials
- TODO: Add directory structure overview and contribution guide

---

## Future Pages

### Design Principles
- Capture architectural beliefs (e.g. config/runtime separation, graph-first modeling)

### Why Neptune?
- Justify the use of a graph DB vs. SQL or NoSQL alternatives

### Karma API
- Document CLI and REST endpoints (e.g., `/graph`, `/request-change`, `/log`)

### Example Graph Visualization
- Small visual system (3–5 components) with labeled nodes and runtime refs

### UI / Viewer Preview
- Placeholder or screenshot of future graph navigation interface

### Gremlin Cheatsheet
- Quick reference of common queries for graph analysis and validation

---

This page will evolve as implementation progresses.
If you're contributing or extending Karma, these are the building blocks ahead.
