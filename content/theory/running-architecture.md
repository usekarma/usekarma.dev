# Karma Runtime Architecture

Karma is a graph-based system for managing infrastructure components, configurations, and runtime state. This page explains how Karma operates under the hood ‚Äî what components exist, how they behave in different modes, and when each mode makes sense.

All modes write to a shared, queryable graph stored in **Amazon Neptune**.

---

## Core Responsibilities

At runtime, Karma must be able to:

- Load component config from Git (via pre-published SSM parameters)
- Load runtime values from Parameter Store
- Build and validate a dependency graph
- Store that graph in Amazon Neptune
- Accept input via CLI, API, or UI
- Evaluate and coordinate proposed changes
- Optionally trigger downstream actions such as:
  - Terraform apply
  - Component reloads
  - Propagated updates
- Log every action for auditability

---

## Execution Modes

Karma supports three runtime models:

---

### üü¢ CLI Mode (On-Demand)

In this mode, Karma runs as a command-line tool:

```bash
karma graph build
karma plan serverless-site karma-dev
karma deploy serverless-site karma-dev
```

- Reads config and runtime from Parameter Store
- Builds the dependency graph in memory
- Writes the graph to Amazon Neptune
- Runs validation or Terraform as needed
- Exits after completion

**Best for:**

- CI/CD pipelines
- Local workflows and prototyping
- Manual deployment and inspection

---

### üü¢ Serverless API Mode (API Gateway + Lambda)

This mode exposes Karma‚Äôs API through **Lambda functions** behind **API Gateway**.

- Each API route maps to a stateless Lambda function
- Reads config and runtime as needed
- Writes updates to Amazon Neptune
- Optionally logs to DynamoDB, S3, or external services

**Example Routes:**

- `GET /graph` ‚Üí Return the latest graph
- `POST /request-change` ‚Üí Propose and apply a change

**Best for:**

- Cloud-native automation
- Event-driven systems and bots
- Low-maintenance external access to Karma‚Äôs graph

---

### üü¢ Service Mode (Live API + Worker)

In service mode, Karma runs continuously with local caching and coordination logic.

#### Key Components

**1. `karma-api`**  
- Provides REST or GraphQL endpoints  
- Handles graph queries, diffing, and change proposals  
- Uses cached state for performance  

**2. `karma-worker`**  
- Processes long-running tasks:
  - Terraform apply
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Validation and dependency updates  

**3. `karma-log`**  
- Captures a durable audit trail of all actions  
- Can log to file, SQLite, DynamoDB, or S3

**Best for:**

- Real-time graph access (e.g. for a UI)
- Coordinated, multi-component change plans
- Large-scale infrastructure with complex dependencies

## Optional Components

| Component      | Description                                         | Required? |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `karma-cli`    | CLI interface for local dev or CI use               | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| `karma-core`   | Shared graph engine used by all modes               | ‚úÖ Yes     |
| `karma-api`    | API (as server or Lambda functions)                 | ‚ùå        |
| `karma-worker` | Background orchestrator for Terraform + updates     | ‚ùå        |
| `karma-log`    | Audit logging system (file, DB, or cloud-native)    | ‚ùå        |
| `karma-ui`     | Optional visual dashboard backed by `karma-api`     | ‚ùå        |

---

## Summary

| Mode                | What it Runs                                | Best for                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| CLI Mode            | Command-line driven, writes graph to Neptune | Simplicity, CI/CD, prototyping     |
| Serverless API Mode | Lambda + API Gateway, stateless              | Cloud-native automation, low ops   |
| Service Mode        | Long-lived processes with graph cache        | Orchestration, UIs, fast queries   |

---

Karma‚Äôs runtime is modular, flexible, and graph-first ‚Äî optimized for systems where **change must be tracked, reasoned about, and safely applied.**
